# Load_prediction_app

## Objective
This machine learning project aims to create a robust ML model and a corresponding web application for status of loan approval process. The goal is to use this system to classify loan applicants, determining whether they should be granted a loan or not.

## Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be assessed based on the F1 Score, ensuring the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying loan applicants.

## Data
About the Data
The dataset comprises information about loan applicants, encompassing 12 independent columns and 1 dependent column. Notable attributes include Loan ID, gender, marital status, education level, applicant's income, and more.

## Dataset
Train and test datasets are provided in repo.

## Data Description
* Loan_ID: A unique identifier assigned to each loan applicant.
* Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male, Female).
* Married: Marital status of the applicant (Yes, No).
* Dependents: Number of people dependent on the applicant (0, 1, 2, 3+).
* Education: Education level of the applicant (Graduated, Not Graduated).
* Self_Employed: Indicates if the applicant is self-employed (Yes, No).
* ApplicantIncome: The amount of income the applicant earns.
* CoapplicantIncome: The amount of income the co-applicant earns.
* LoanAmount: The amount of loan the applicant has requested.
* Loan_Amount_Term: The number of days over which the loan will be paid.
* Credit_History: A record of a borrower's responsible repayment of debts (1 - all debts paid, 0 - not paid).
* Property_Area: The type of location where the applicantâ€™s property lies (Rural, Semiurban, Urban).

Target:
* Loan_Status: Indicates whether the loan was granted or not (Y, N).
